# Diabetes-Prediction
# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning-based classification model to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes or not, based on medical diagnostic data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction can help in better treatment and management of this condition. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to classify whether a person has diabetes based on various features like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Diabetes Dataset**, which is publicly available on [Kaggle].

### Features:
## Column Descriptions
1. Age: Age of the individual in years.</br>
2. Sex: Gender of the individual (e.g., Male, Female).</br>
3. Ethnicity: Ethnic background (e.g., White, Asian, Black, Hispanic).</br>
4. BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on weight and height.</br>
5. Waist Circumference: Measurement of waist size in centimeters.</br>
6. Fasting Blood Glucose: Blood glucose levels after fasting, measured in mg/dL.
7. HbA1c: Glycated hemoglobin percentage, indicating average blood sugar levels over the past 2–3 months.</br>
8. Blood Pressure Systolic: Systolic blood pressure (top number), measured in mmHg.</br>
9. Blood Pressure Diastolic: Diastolic blood pressure (bottom number), measured in mmHg.</br>
10. Cholesterol Total: Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.</br>
11. Cholesterol HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein): "Good" cholesterol level in mg/dL.</br>
12. Cholesterol LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein): "Bad" cholesterol level in mg/dL.</br>
13. GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase): Liver enzyme level indicative of liver function or damage.</br>
14. Serum Urate: Uric acid levels in the blood, measured in mg/dL.</br>
15. Physical Activity Level: Level of physical activity (e.g., Low, Moderate, High).</br>
16. Dietary Intake Calories: Daily calorie intake in kilocalories.</br>
17. Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol consumption level (e.g., None, Moderate, Heavy).</br>
18. Smoking Status: Smoking habits (e.g., Never, Former, Current).</br>
19. Family History of Diabetes: 1 = Family history present; 0 = No family history of diabetes.</br>
20. Previous Gestational Diabetes: 1 = History of gestational diabetes; 0 = No history.</br>
